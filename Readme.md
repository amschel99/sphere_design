# Requirements for New Sphere Design Version  
**Objective:** Create a completely new design for Sphere to be A/B tested against the current version. The goal is to identify which design performs better in terms of usability, desirability, and user engagement.  

---

## 1. **Scope of Work**  
The new design must include the following core features of Sphere:  
1. **Unified Multichain Wallet (Home Tab)**:  
   - Display assets from multiple chains in a unified view.  
   - Ensure clarity of chain-specific details (e.g., balances, network).  

2. **Click to Collect**:  
   - Redesign the flow for creating and sharing payment links.  
   - Highlight expiration time and security features.  

3. **Secret-Key Management**:  
   - Simplify the process of storing and sharing secrets (e.g., API keys).  
   - Clearly communicate security measures (e.g., Shamir secret sharing).  

4. **Rewards & Viral Growth**:  
   - Redesign the rewards dashboard (locked airdrops, tasks).  
   - Make referral and task completion flows intuitive.  

5. **DeFi Staking**:  
   - Redesign the staking interface with clear yield terms and risks.  
   - Ensure users understand the process and benefits.  

6. **Navigation & Onboarding**:  
   - Simplify navigation between tabs.  
   - Create a seamless onboarding experience for new users.

## 2. **Design Principles**  
- **Clarity**: Ensure all features are self-explanatory.  
- **Trust**: Communicate security and reliability at every step.  
- **Engagement**: Make the app visually appealing and interactive.  
- **Accessibility**: Design for both crypto-native and mainstream users.

## 3. **Deliverables**  
1. **High-Fidelity Prototypes** (Figma or equivalent):  
   - Complete redesign of all core features (see Scope of Work).  
   - Interactive flows for key tasks (e.g., sending a Click to Collect link).  

2. **Design System**:  
   - Typography, color palette, and UI components.  
   - Consistent icons and visual language.  

3. **User Testing Materials**:  
   - Task flows for A/B testing (e.g., “Send $50 to a friend”).  
   - Survey questions to compare user satisfaction (SUS, NPS).  

4. **Documentation**:  
   - Explanation of design decisions (e.g., why a specific flow was chosen).  
   - Accessibility considerations (e.g., font sizes, contrast).  

---

## 4. **Timeline**  
- **Day 1–3**: Research and ideation (study current design, identify pain points).  
- **Day 4–7**: Wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes.  
- **Day 8–12**: High-fidelity prototypes and design system.  
- **Day 13–14**: Final review and preparation for user testing.  

---

## 5. **Success Metrics**  
The new design will be evaluated against the current version based on:  
1. **Usability**:  
   - Task success rate.  
   - Time-on-task.  
   - Error rate.  

2. **Desirability**:  
   - Net Promoter Score (NPS).  
   - User preference (e.g., “Which design do you prefer?”).  

3. **Engagement**:  
   - Likelihood to use specific features (e.g., Click to Collect, rewards).  
   - Willingness to refer friends.

## 7. **Tools**  
- **Design**: Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD.  
- **User Testing**: Maze, Hotjar, or UsabilityHub.  
- **Collaboration**: Miro, Notion, or Confluence.  

---

**Note**: The new design should not only look different but also address any usability issues identified in the current version. The goal is to create a design that is both visually appealing and functionally superior.
