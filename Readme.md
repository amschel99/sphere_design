# Sphere User Research Framework (Lean UX)  
**Timeframe:** 2 weeks  
**Goal:** Validate usability, desirability, and clarity of Sphere’s core features. Iterate based on feedback.  

---

## 1. Framework Structure (Lean UX Cycle)  
### **Phase 1: Build Assumptions & Prototypes (Days 1–3)**  
- **Hypotheses**:  
  - Users understand and trust the "unified multichain wallet".  
  - "Click to Collect" is preferred over traditional crypto transfers.  
  - Non-tech users feel safe storing/sharing secrets (e.g., API keys).  
  - Locked airdrop rewards drive referrals and engagement.  
- **Prototypes**:  
  - Low/high-fidelity Figma flows for key tasks (e.g., Click to Collect, staking).  
  - Demo video explaining Shamir secret sharing and security.  

### **Phase 2: Test & Learn (Days 4–10)**  
- **User Sessions**:  
  - 5–10 users (mix of crypto-native and mainstream).  
  - 60-minute sessions: Task-based testing + open feedback.  
- **Metrics**: Track KPIs (see below).  

### **Phase 3: Iterate & Validate (Days 11–14)**  
- Refine prototypes based on feedback.  
- Re-test critical pain points with 3–5 users.  
- Finalize prioritized changes.

## 2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  
### **Usability (Quantitative)**  
- **Task Success Rate**: % of users completing tasks (e.g., creating a Click to Collect link).  
- **Time-on-Task**: Avg. time for key actions (e.g., sending crypto vs. Click to Collect).  
- **Error Rate**: Misclicks, navigation confusion.  
- **System Usability Scale (SUS)**: Post-test survey (1–5 scale).  

### **Desirability (Qualitative)**  
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: “How likely are you to recommend Sphere?” (0–10).  
- **Feature Appeal**: Ranking of features by usefulness (1–5).  
- **Trust**: Confidence in security (secret sharing, key storage).  

### **Feature-Specific Metrics**  
- **Click to Collect**:  
  - Preference over traditional transfers.  
  - Intended use cases (payments, gifts, subscriptions).  
- **Secret-Key Infra**:  
  - Willingness to store/share API keys (e.g., OpenAI).  
  - Understanding of Shamir secret sharing.  
- **Rewards**:  
  - Likelihood to refer friends for airdrops.  
  - Most appealing unlock tasks (referrals, staking).  
- **DeFi Staking**:  
  - Clarity of yield terms/risks.  
  - Trust in Sphere’s DeFi integration.

## 3. User Research Questions  
### **A. Onboarding & First Impressions**  
- “How would you describe Sphere in your own words?”  
- “What’s confusing or unclear on the Home tab?”  
- “How would you send $50 to a friend? Why?”  

### **B. Click to Collect**  
- “How would you use this feature in real life?”  
- “What worries you about expiring payment links?”  
- “Is this easier than sending crypto to an address? Why/why not?”  

### **C. Secret-Key Management**  
- “Would you store an OpenAI key here? Why?”  
- “How comfortable are you lending keys for rewards?”  
- “How would you explain Sphere’s security to a friend?”  

### **D. Rewards & Viral Growth**  
- “Which tasks would you complete first to unlock airdrops?”  
- “Would you refer friends to Sphere? What would motivate you?”  
- “What’s unclear about the rewards system?”  

### **E. DeFi Staking**  
- “What do you expect to happen when you stake tokens here?”  
- “What risks do you see in staking via Sphere?”  

### **F. Trust & Security**  
- “How safe do you feel using Sphere for multichain assets?”  
- “Would you use this for high-value transactions? Why/why not?”

## 4. Execution Plan  
### **Recruitment**  
- **10 users**: 5 crypto-savvy (DeFi users), 5 mainstream (Telegram users).  
- **Incentives**: $50 in tokens or gift cards.  

### **Tools**  
- **Hotjar/Zoom**: Screen recording + facial reactions.  
- **Google Forms**: Post-session SUS/NPS surveys.  
- **Miro Board**: Affinity mapping of feedback.  

### **Deliverables**  
- Prioritized usability fixes (e.g., confusing terminology).  
- Feature adoption blockers (e.g., distrust in key sharing).  
- User quotes highlighting emotional responses.  
- Revised prototypes for next sprint.

## 5. Example Task Flow  
1. **Task 1**: Send $50 to a friend using Click to Collect.  
2. **Task 2**: Store an OpenAI key and share access for 24 hours.  
3. **Task 3**: Check your locked airdrop and unlock it via referrals.  
4. **Task 4**: Stake tokens and explain the expected rewards.  

**Observe**: Hesitation points, trust in irreversible actions.

**Final Tip**: Prioritize friction points (security fears, unclear rewards) and iterate fast!
